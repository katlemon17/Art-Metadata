# Art-Metadata

This data science project looks at metadata of artwork owned by the Tate Museum. The methodology used here to analyze the metadata is based on the one outlined in Text Mining with R, by Julia Silge and David Robinson. 

File organization and structure are modelled after Jeff Leek and Roger D. Peng's Advanced Data Science course.
